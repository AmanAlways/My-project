<p><b>What is Music?</b><br> Music is the ‘art of combining tones in a manner to please the ear’. It may also mean sounds so combined as to make a pleasant impression on the mind.
All sound, however, is not music. It is only when the sounds (combined) produce harmony and melody and please the ear that they become music.
Music paves the way for the absorption of the mind in the Supreme. In fact, it is an innocent and refining diversion.</p>
<p class="dark">Everyone knows how the song or Orpheus, the great musician of ancient Greece, proved captivating to stones, trees and flood.
The song of Tansen at Akbar’s court brought about a heavy shower and kindled a fire. Music not only rouses various feelings but also quiets the worried and wearied soul.</p>

    <p> We can play a musical instrument. Alternatively, we can listen to a song according to our mood or choice. Either way, music enhances our lives in many ways.</p>
